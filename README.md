**Arrays**

An array is a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. It allows indexed access, where the first element is at index `0`.

Syntax:

    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};


Key Points:
- Size must be defined at compile time.
- Access via `arr[i]`.
- Useful for loop-based processing like sorting, searching, and pattern printing.
- Arrays in C++ don't have built-in methodsâ€”developers manually implement logic for traversal and manipulation.

**Strings**

Strings in C++ can be represented in two ways:  
1. C-style strings: Arrays of characters ending with a `'\0'` null terminator.
   
   char str[] = "hello";
  
2. `string` class(from `<string>` library): Offers rich functionality like length calculation, concatenation, and substring extraction.
   
       string s = "world";


Key Differences:
- C-style strings demand manual handling of size and termination.
- `string` objects simplify operations but may hide underlying logic, which is less suitable for low-level learning.

Arrays and C-style strings foster deep understanding of memory layout and indexing. They are essential for mastering logic-based algorithms in C++.

# Algorithm

1) Algorithm of array elements.
   i) Initialize an integer array
    - Define numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
  ii) Calculate array size
    - Use arraySize = sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(numbers[0])
      (This computes the total number of elements in the array)
 iii) Display a header message
   - Print "Elements of the array:" to console
 iV) Traverse the array using a loop
   - Run a for loop with index i from 0 to arraySize - 1
   - On each iteration, print numbers[i] followed by a space
 V) Move to a new line after loop ends
 Vi) End the program

2) Algorithm of 




# Conclusion

Arrays and strings in C++ form the backbone of structured data handling. Mastering their indexing, memory layout, and manipulation lays the foundation for deeper algorithmic logic and efficient program design.
